Preliminaries
=============

I use unicode in the source and here. DejaVu Sans Mono[1] is the font I'm using.

[1] http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page

The code compiles with g++ 4.5 and above. See below for more compilation notes.

I've written the code in a way that permits direct reading. So, after reading
this file, DeBruijnBind.hpp would be the next file to read.

Purpose
=======

This is an alternate bind syntax that is both simpler and/or more powerful than
other libraries I'm aware off. The use of De Bruijn indicies[1] makes this
possible.

Grammar
=======
Using EBNF here.

    abstraction = 'abs<', int, '>', '(', expression, ')';

    expression = abstraction
               | application
               | value
               | variable;

    application = 'app(', expression, { ',', expression }, ')';

    variable = 'var<', int non zero, ',', int non zero, '>';

    value = any c++ value that isn't a variable or a tdepth 0;

    int = digit, {digit};

    int non zero = digit non zero, {digit};

    digit = "0" | digit non zero;

    digit non zero = "1" | "2" | "3" ... "9";

The abstraction here requires an int to declare how many arguments the newly
created function has.

Variables have two ints, the first corresponds to which nested abstraction we're
referring to. 1 is inner most one and so on outward. The second int corresponds
to which argument within the abstraction is being referred to, 1 being the
first.

Examples
========

In lambda and then De Bruijn indices.

    id = λx. x = λ1

    const = λx.λy.x = λλ2

    compose = λx.λy.λz.x(y(z)) = λλλ3(2(1))

For flip, I'm introducing subscripts on abstractions (λ) to indicate the
number of arguments. For the variables (1,2,etc.) I use a subscript to indicate
which argument of the abstraction it refers to.

    flip = λx.λ(y,z).x(z,y) = λ₁λ₂1(1₁, 2₀)

These terms can be directly translated into C++ code using this library.

    auto id = abs<1>( var<1,1>() );

    auto const_ = abs<1>( abs<1>( var<2,1>() ) );

    auto flip   = abs<1>( abs<2>( app( var<2,1>()
                                     , var<1,2>()
                                     , var<1,1>()
                                     )
                                )
                        );

    auto compose = abs<2>( abs<1>( app( var<2,1>()
                                      , app( var<2,2>()
                                           , var<1,1>()
                                           )
                                      )
                                 )
                         );

Compilation
===========
The Visual C++ 2010 compiler crashes when compiling this code. See [1] and [2]
for possible explanations. Versions of gcc prior to 4.5 also crash when
compiling this code[3].

Listed C++0x support for gcc and Visual C++ can be found here[4] and here[5]
respectively.

Todo
====
* Add a curry/uncurry example.
* Rename abs to lam and var to arg.
* Ensure that when an abstraction is used like a function, that it disallows
  parameters that have a tdepth > 0.
* To make our eager evaluator consistant, the app function should reduce the
  app if it has tdepth = 0.
* Add more abstraction function call overloads and app overloads (boost 
  preprocessor?).
* Backport to C++-98.

Futher Out Todo
===============
* Add a lazy app (lapp) that only evaluates when absolutely required.
* Make a separate file that includes first class functions that equate to
  several of the commonly used operators.
