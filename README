I use unicode in the source and here. ... is the font I'm using.

Compilation
===========
The Visual C++ 2010 compiler crashes when compiling this code. See [1] and [2]
for possible explanations. Versions of gcc prior to 4.5 also crash when
compiling this code[3].

Listed C++0x support for gcc and Visual C++ can be found here[4] and here[5]
respectively.

Todo
====
* Clean up the repository (separate files, etc).
* Fix documentation at top of file (0 vs. 1 indexed) and perhaps move it here.
* Ensure that when an abstraction is used like a function, that it disallows
  parameters that have a tdepth > 0.
* To make our eager evaluator consistant, the app function should reduce the
  app if it has tdepth = 0.
* Add more abstraction function call overloads  and app overloads (boost 
  preprocessor?).

Futher Out Todo
===============
* Add a lazy app (lapp) that only evaluates when absolutely required.
* Make a separate file that includes first class functions that equate to
  several of the commonly used operators.
